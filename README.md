# Ducky
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mystor/ducky.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mystor/ducky)

Ducky is going to be a statically typed language which focuses on using structural types to enable super easy and typesafe, duck typing.

Ducky is also a way for me to learn rust, which I have been wanting to learn for a while. Don't be surprised if this remains a learning toy.

## Progress

This will never be updated unless I feel like I did something impressive. So don't trust it.

### Parser [Done (for now)]
### Type Inference [WIP]
### Compiling [Unstarted]
### Optimizing [Unstarted]
### Libraries and Stuff [Unstarted]
